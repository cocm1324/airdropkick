# airdropkick
I want to use but I can't aford Mac :(

--------------

Basic idea is like this: 


Developers like me has several devices with different operating system. Now, while I'm writing this, I have Ubuntu laptop, Windows laptop, iPad, and iPhone. I usually use mail or messenger app(such as KakaoTalk) to transfer files between different devices. 


As previous user of Mac(stupidely, I sold it to some other guy), I deeply appriciated the 'airdrop' feature of Mac between my Apple devices. The problem is, after I sold the Mac, I am getting pissed when I'm tring to send small files to another device.

The goal of this project is this; 
1. Cross platform, 
2. bluetooth connection based file or short message transfer application.
